Features:

First comment (post immediately):
"Hi HN,

Built this because I couldn't find a privacy-respecting
PDF angle corrector. Everything runs in-browser using
PDF.js and pdf-lib.

Tech stack:
- React 19 + TypeScript
- PDF.js 3.11 for rendering
- pdf-lib for manipulation
- File System Access API for saves
- 100% static (hosted on Vercel)

Interesting challenges:
- Coordinate system math for rotation
- File System Access API browser compat
- Performance with large PDFs

Would love technical feedback!
