## 🚀 Project Status & Current Phase

**Current Status:** Week 1 AI Feature Implementation Complete - Canvas Bug Needs Fix
**Current Phase:** Week 1 Completion - Critical Bug Fix Required
**Next Milestone:** Fix canvas reuse error in multi-page PDF Auto-Fix → Week 2
**Target Launch:** Week 5 (after AI feature completion)

**⚠️ CRITICAL BUG:**
- **Error:** `pdf.min.js:22 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Cannot use the same canvas during multiple render() operations`
- **Location:** App.tsx lines 705-737 (Auto-Fix button for multi-page PDFs)
- **Impact:** Auto-Fix button crashes when processing multi-page PDFs
- **Status:** Attempted fix with canvas cleanup did NOT resolve issue
- **Next Action:** Investigate PDF.js render task cancellation and proper canvas isolation

## Project Overview

This is a web-based PDF and image angle correction tool built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to upload PDFs or images, apply precise rotation adjustments (±15°), reposition pages with middle-button drag, and export corrected files in multiple formats.

**Core Value Proposition:** 100% client-side processing (privacy-first) with batch processing capabilities.

## Commands

**Development:**
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Architecture

### State Management Architecture

The application uses React 19's `useState` for state management with these key state domains:

- **File State**: `files`, `fileType` ('pdf' | 'image'), `pdfDoc`, `imageUrls`
- **Transform State**: `rotations` (Record<pageNumber, degrees>), `pageOffsets` (Record<pageNumber, {x, y}>)
- **Selection State**: `selectedPages` (Set<pageNumber>) - determines which pages receive rotation adjustments
- **UI State**: `exportFormat`, `status`, `statusMessage`, `isDragging`, `showGuidelines`, `sliderValue`

### Key Behavioral Patterns

**Rotation System:**
- Slider adjusts rotation for selected pages (or all pages if none selected)
- Rotation state is per-page (1-indexed page numbers as keys)
- After save, rotations reset to 0 and images are reloaded with baked-in corrections

**Offset System:**
- Middle-button drag applies x/y offsets to individual pages
- Offsets are applied in addition to rotation during rendering and export
- Canvas rendering uses center-based transforms with offset compensation

**Selection System:**
- Multi-page PDFs support page selection via checkboxes
- Selected pages receive rotation adjustments together
- Empty selection applies changes to all pages

### Service Layer

**`services/pdfService.ts`:**
- `createRotatedPdf()` - Uses pdf-lib to create new PDF with rotated pages and applied offsets
- Rotation logic: negates user angle (slider positive = clockwise) for pdf-lib's counter-clockwise system
- Center-rotation is achieved via offset calculations before drawing pages

**`services/imageService.ts`:**
- `rotateAndExportImage()` - Canvas-based rotation and format export (jpg/png/webp)
- `createPdfFromImages()` - Creates PDF from multiple images using pdf-lib
- `detectTiltAngle()` - **NEW (Week 1)**: AI angle detection system
  - **Primary Method:** Hough Line Transform (OpenCV.js) - detects straight lines
  - **Fallback Method:** Text baseline detection (Tesseract.js OCR)
  - **Key Features:**
    - Clustering algorithm for majority voting (groups angles within 1°)
    - Border filtering (excludes 5% margin to ignore scan borders)
    - Length filtering (ignores lines < 10% of image width)
    - Confidence-based method selection (≥0.7 threshold)
  - **Algorithm:** Lines first → Text fallback → Return 0° if both fail
  - **Status:** Works well for most documents, needs canvas bug fix

### External Dependencies (CDN)

**PDF Processing:**
- `pdf.js` 3.11.174 - PDF rendering to canvas for preview
- `pdf-lib` 1.17.1 - PDF manipulation and creation

**AI/Computer Vision:**
- `OpenCV.js` 4.8.0 - Line detection, contour detection (CDN)
- `Tesseract.js` - OCR text detection (npm package)

**UI:**
- TailwindCSS via CDN
- React 19 via AI Studio CDN import maps

All loaded via CDN or npm, typed via types.ts `declare global`

### Critical Implementation Details

**Transform Coordinate Systems:**
- Canvas/screen Y-axis increases downward (standard web coordinates)
- Offsets applied directly without negation in image service
- PDF service applies offsets after rotation transform calculations

**Save Behavior:**
- File System Access API (Chrome/Edge) used first for save dialog
- Falls back to traditional download for unsupported browsers
- After save, rotations and offsets reset to 0 (shows "saved state")
- Image mode: reloads images with baked-in corrections

**Page Numbering:**
- All page numbers are 1-indexed throughout the application
- Maps/Records use page numbers (not array indices) as keys

**AI Auto-Detection (Week 1 Implementation):**
- "✨ Auto-Fix with AI" button added to UI
- Detection strategy: Lines → Text → Fail gracefully (return 0°)
- Works on both single images and multi-page PDFs
- ⚠️ Known issue: Canvas reuse error on multi-page PDFs (see Critical Bug above)
- Detection quality: Good for structured documents, needs improvement for noisy receipts

## 🚨 Important Reminders

### When Working on Features
1. **Always check ROADMAP.md** for current week's priorities
2. **Focus on Phase 1 (AI feature)** before marketing
3. **Don't skip testing** - accuracy >85% is critical
4. **Keep privacy-first** - no server upload, ever

### When Making Decisions
1. **Consult COMMERCIALIZATION.md** for strategic context
2. **Check decision gates** before major changes
3. **Update metrics** after any launch/marketing activity
4. **Review ROI** before spending time/money

### Red Flags (Stop and Reassess)
- 🚩 Week 8: Metrics far below target (PIVOT consideration)
- 🚩 Week 12: MRR <$50 (Business viability question)
- 🚩 Any week: User feedback consistently negative (Product issue)
- 🚩 Any week: Critical technical blocker (Scope down)
